# Project for Two Hat interview

## Tools Used

Since the data set given was a JSON file, it seemed that using MongoDB for its indexation would be perfect. To an easier use of the database, it was implemented an Dockerfile and a docker-compose script for the service running using Docker.

## Installation

Clone, download or fork the repository. Done that, access the project directory in you console and run `docker-compose up` to initiate the services. Then, run `npm install` to install all Node dependencies.

## Scripts

The script implemented returns the players that had the most messages filtered

## Testing the Project

Just run `node script.js`.
